## Overview

CCQA is a novel inference-time reasoning method designed specifically for **Small Language Models (SLMs)**. Inspired by cycle consistency, CCQA generates questions from candidate solutions and selects the most reliable answer by measuring similarity to the original question.

### Key Features

- **Designed for SLMs**: Addresses limitations of existing reasoning methods for smaller models (135M-3B parameters)
- **Cycle Consistency**: Evaluates reasoning quality by regenerating questions from solutions
- **Efficient**: Uses lightweight Flan-T5 model for backward question generation
